## Description
System controls the statements around the object by checking the distances with five Ultrasonic Sensors. The Sensors work <b>Separately</b>, in <b>Pairs</b>, in <b>Triples</b>, in <b>Quad</b> and all <b>Five</b> together. The Neural Networks are implemented for all of these different approaches. Neural Networks show the results in form of <b>"Alarm"</b> and <b>"Warning"</b>. The intervals for each sensor in each communication form are shown in the figures below. The Neural Networks are already adjusted and all Weights and Biases are set. All Neural Networks have the same <b>Input Vector</b> which is the current value of each sensor.
